## About The App
This app is just a simple website created with React, React-Router, Reactstrap, styled components and owl carousel. 
This app is just a means to showcase my UI developpent skills. 
The app was hosted on Netlify - https://faith-health-app.netlify.com
N.B: The forms are not working because it is just a practice project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
